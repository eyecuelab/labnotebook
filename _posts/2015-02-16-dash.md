As a full-stack developer, I use many different technologies at once. I spend a lot of time reading API documentation to learn about features of languages or frameworks.  

I've also noticed a lot of developers engage in an endless pursuit to streamline the development workflow. We adopt tools that allow us to be more efficient in our everyday tasks.

Lately, I've discovered a tool called [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash). It's an API documentation browser that locally stores entire documentation sets for over 150 languages and frameworks. You choose which docsets to download, and it stores and keeps them up to date.

I use this tool almost daily. It runs as a native app on my Mac, and I have it set up to show the app when I press <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd>, allowing me quick access to search for a method or property that has slipped my mind.

You can try the app for free, but it has built-in limits until you purchase the full version. I saw the value and I paid for it shortly after I started using it. I haven't looked back since. 

Check it out!
