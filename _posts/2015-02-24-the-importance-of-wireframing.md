![Wireframes]({{ site.postimage}}wireframe.jpg)

As a product designer at a software company, I have realized the importance of producing an effective wireframe. Wireframes allow me to organize information in a hierarchical order, which makes it easier to plan and lay out how the information should be processed.

Wireframes are crucial because they focus on:

* Available functions
* Information architecture and layout
* User interface functionality
* Relationships between different screen templates of a website
* Navigation design

<br><br>

My wireframing process includes the following:

1. Get inspiration
2. Sketch
3. Pick your tool (OmniGraffle, Balsamiq, Illustrator, etc)
4. Design

<br><br>

While most designers are busy creating pixel-perfect comps and focusing too much time on thinking about the visual part of the product, wireframes allow you to prototype and create a blueprint that can be easily edited and experimented with.
